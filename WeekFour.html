    <h2>Week Four</h2>

    <P> Why do you see JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries useful or hard to use?<br>
        I'm enjoying the programming challenge of working in JavaScript.
        I find concepts like the scope of variables and calling functions different 
        from anything I've encountered before. Javascript is a combination of powerful
        features, protection from making errors and "why did they do that?"  
        It will take some time to master, but because of its power and libraries 
        should be well worth the effort.  I am also going to learn C# just to give
        me another modern, web language to work with and compare.
    </p>
    <p> What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?<br>
        At this point I really don't know enough about what Frameworks are available
        and their differences to actually know which I'd like to dive into.  
    </p>
    <p> Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.<br>
        The Frameworks which most interest me are Node.JS, Vue.JS, React and Meteor.js.  
        Meteor.js interests me because it is both full-stack and 
        cross-platform.  An added bonus is its claim to be great for 
        rapid prototyping.  And then there is Rust by the Mozilla Foundation.
        Reading about Rust I thought that it sounded like how things should be done.
    </P>
