                <p>Why do you see JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries useful or hard to use?</p>
                <p>
                    I don't find the React being hard to use, just totally 
                    impossible for me at the moment.  With JSX I find the syntax 
                    fiendishly finicky.  The mind shift required to transition to 
                    object oriented with high levels of abstraction is, at its best, 
                    frustrating. But I shall persevere. I just won't enjoy the process. 
                </p>

                <p>What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>
                    The one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about is 
                    C#! I know that it is a competing product but the language is so popular that 
                    learning it should give me a leg up on finding a job. The ability to use one 
                    language to write a program which can run on desktop computers, Android phones, 
                    as well as Apple phones and computers is too great to be ignored. My plan it to 
                    learn it by rewriting all of my projects in it. After all I will most likely have 
                    a long time to improve and expand my skills in the face of the coming social and 
                    economic recession, hopefully not a real depression.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The COVID-19 virus forced the Bootcamp to transition to on-line instruction 
                    Wednesday at noon.  That was the right thing to do, but I am not progressing 
                    whatsoever at the moment.  I'm trying to read something from the documentation 
                    and put my understanding of it into code. That has been a total disaster. 
                    I can't seem to get anything to work and waste hours trying to get code to 
                    work in the wrong file or in the wrong manner.  This leaves me mentally exhausted 
                    to the point that I can't keep track of what I'm trying to do. A total waste of 
                    my and my instructor's time. I've spent two entire days trying to display a 
                    TicTacToe board using two loops and don't have a single line of code to show 
                    for my effort. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    A further worry for me is my MacBook Pro.  All day Friday it was 
                    overheating most severely. Several times the sound went out or it shut down 
                    due to either the heat or problems caused by the heat. I reset the PRAM and SMC 
                    chips several times and left it shutdown overnight. Saturday it gave me only one 
                    problem and Sunday it overheated only once. I performed the built in hardware 
                    diagnostics check twice without any problems being found. I'm still worried.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But I am not defeated. I will not quit. I'll blow out my brains 
                    before I drop out. The only way I made it through almost every day of my last 
                    four years at Amazon was making plans to kill myself everyday. That really got 
                    the anger whipped up so I could make rate, keep my job and feed my family. 
                    Although extremely frustrated and totally 
                    pessimistic at the moment I also feel more alive than I have felt in years. 
                    Programming is what God made me for. It's the only job or hobby that I was ever 
                    somewhat successful at. I wish Ernie didn't get his business stolen from 
                    him, he didn't pay that great but he was a great person to work with and for. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    God I feel defeated. Is this depression coming on? No, not as long as I see a path forward.
