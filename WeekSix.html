    <h2>Week Six</h2>

<p>This week I learned that objects are a developer's best friend.
    Not only do they store data but they organize it so it
    is easily reusable saving time, typing and errors. </p>


<p>Good code is
    lean, efficient, and written so is is largely self-commenting. Don't get me wrong;
    comments are needed to help in understanding what the developer intended but they
    are so valuable that they shouldn't be wasted to explain that variable w holds the
    intermediate value of our calculation or array q holds the keys used to access our
    data. Naming conventions should be followed to allow the logic of the program to
    be seen clearly.</p>

<p>There is a difference between writing good code and being a good developer.
    A good developer designs programs and
    systems so they can be maintained, adapted and parts can be reused both
    right away and in the future. The majority of the cost of a program (or system)
    is in the maintenance portion of its life. Good development minimizes this cost.</p>

<p>Programmers hate typing because it wastes time. Also the longer the
    code is the more likely there is an error in it simply because it is
    harder to understand.</p>
