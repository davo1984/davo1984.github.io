Week 12 - Main Camp
What was your experience like overall in the Bootcamp?
This has been one massive bit of stress which has left me burnt out and teetering on the edge of an episode of Major Depression. I guess in the US one is never to mention such things. Well, that is just a part of me. Once I get a job and begin mixing with intelligent people, for the first time in years, I'm sure that I'll bounce right back. I always do.

When you look back on this blog, where do you see yourself growing the most?
I grew the most in rekindling my love of programming. I had gotten away from that and had been hiding from the fact that that is what God has put me on this earth to do for a living. What stresses me out the most is the idea of not being able to find a job developing programs.

Make sure your final portfolio, blog, homepage, final project, and whatever else are online and linked so future employers can learn about everything you did!
