    <h2>Week Two</H2>
    <P>
        Figuring out what is required to be posted as completed work is 
        still challenging for me.  I made a list Thursday during stand-up which left out three items 
        I noticed that all my co-students had posted.  I found where I had done them and added  
        links to those items.  Perhaps the hardest thing is simply determining what day of the week it is.
        Thursday at stand-up I told of my plans for the next 24 hours thinking that it was Wednesday.  
        I was only corrected by my wife just before bedtime when I was planning which vehicle to take to
        work.

        I like pseudo coding and flow charting.  That was how I planned every new program I had to write
        when I worked as a programmer back in the 90s.  Especially diagramming with flow charts.  
        Diagramming was how I planned how programs and parts of a system would interact with one another.  
        Every part that I couldn't figure out became an empty box.  Once I had figured out what the 
        inputs and outputs were, usually what to do with them was greatly simplified.

        I am super excited to be learning a new programming language. Teaching myself a new language
        I find to be extremely difficult because the main thing I need is a worthy project to
        make it worthwhile.  Working with others is also a major plus for me. I don't do very well
        without the stimulation I get from interacting with other educated and intelligent people.
        If that makes me an intellectual then I'm unapologetic.
