    <H2>Week Three</H3>

    <p>
        First I need to offer apologies to my fellow students for not offering 
        any advice on your blogs.  The ones I did look at intimidated me.
    </p>

    <p>
        I like the separation of effort between html, CSS, JS and SQL.  That 
        just makes sense to me because that's how I try to organize my life.  
        On the down side it is very tedious and error prone.  Often I find that
        what I was thinking about when I find a new home for a tool or bookmark 
        a link isn't what I'm thinking about when I go to retrieve it. Although 
        I want to be detail oriented I find myself being more of an abstract and 
        "Big Picture" type of person.  What data do I need, how will it be 
        deconstructed, manipulated and stored and retrieved? What program needs
        to do what to which data are tasks that energize me. Designing 
        shadows for drop boxes on forms I don't find so compelling. 
    </p>

    <p>
        That's why I was excited to read an article describing how frameworks 
        become an abstraction layer allowing one to focus on what needs to be
        done rather than on what to do while minimizing bugs.
    </p>

    <p>
        My one big Ah-Ha! moment was margin -> border -> padding -> content NOT
        content -> margin -> border -> padding. My method is to plug in a few 
        bizarre values so which does what becomes obvious.
    </p>

    <p>
        My "oh rats" moments:
        <ul > 
            <li>I realized that the border I was going to add was/is 
                already there, just not displaying.  Not even "Developer Tools" shed 
                any light.</li>
            <li>
                Now I need sub-menu navigation for these weekly blog posts.
            </li>
            <li> There never seems to be enough time to go as deeply as I would like.  
                I need a quick day trip to visit my parents before the in-class session begins.</li>
            <li>There was a delay in getting my computer eyeglasses made.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
