    <h2>Week One</h2>

    <P>This first week passed in a blur of information that left me feeling like I was drinking 
            from a firehose.  Working through the GitHub tutorials felt like all of my concentration 
            was solely focused on getting through the tutorial rather than actually learning the 
            material.   I plan on doing a more in-depth review as time permits.   Also just trying to 
            figure out what format to turn in this work is unsettling.   I am looking forward in 
            eagar anticipation to the coming week. 
    </P>
