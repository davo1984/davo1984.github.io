Week 1
What did you learn about that helped you understand more about design?
previously i understood how important contrast was but i had not considered how many different 
elements could be used to produce interesting contrast.

What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand design better?
i have a book on design I want to study. I'm also going to take up something again.

What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?
As a user I'm less concerned with looks and the biggest "feature list"than with how it actually is to use. 
Tax Slayer is the best example
of this. Ease of use trumps nice to look at every time.

What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
there is so much information to learn that i feel like I'm drinking from a fire hose, I can't drink it all 
but i am getting enough to keep me hydrated so i can carry on. design is not my strong point now, but it can be learned. 
most of the class felt stressed and just "not good enough.". i felt on the edge of a panic attack but we all pushed 
through it.  Good practice for on the job stresses.

What is one thing you would like to get better at in bootcamp?
I most need to get better with finishing the reading earlier in the week. If course here i am in
a hospital in Ohio with my father who has pneumonia and just suffered an AFib episode.  Poor prognosis for 17 
months pregnant one study. I'm reading and studying, including writing this, as best as i can. I also need to 
take care of myself better, back to meditating everyday and more exercise.  when i did both my stress went down
went up.and my confidence
