    <h3>Awesome Inc Bootcamp</h3>

    <h2>Week Five</h2>

    <p>What did you learn about that helped you understand more about design?
        previously i understood how important contrast was but i had not considered how many different
        elements could be used to produce interesting contrast.
    </p>
    <p>What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand design better?
        i have a book on design I want to study. I'm also going to take up something again.
    </p>
    <p>What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?
        As a user I'm less concerned with looks and the biggest "feature list"than with how it actually is to use.
        Tax Slayer is the best example
        of this. Ease of use trumps nice to look at every time.
    </p>
    <p>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
        there is so much information to learn that i feel like I'm drinking from a fire hose, I can't drink it all
        but i am getting enough to keep me hydrated so i can carry on. design is not my strong point now, but it can be       learned.
        most of the class felt stressed and just "not good enough.". i felt on the edge of a panic attack but we all
        pushed    through it. Good practice for on the job stresses.
    </p>
    <p>What is one thing you would like to get better at in bootcamp?
        I most need to get better with finishing the reading earlier in the week. If course here i am in
        a hospital in Ohio with my father who has pneumonia and just suffered an AFib episode. Poor prognosis for 17
        months pregnant one study. I'm reading and studying, including writing this, as best as i can. I also need to
        take care of myself better, back to meditating everyday and more exercise. when i did both my stress went down
        and my confidence went up.
    </p>

    <p>On a more personal note I'm finishing the week extremely poorly. My plan was to do the bouncing ball 
        exercise, get the blog playing nicely with bootstrap, restyle mindreader with bootstrap, and get 
        the campaign exercise working more to my liking.  My Dad wound up in the hospital with pneumonia
        and then goes into AFib.  Any elderly person in the hospital with pneumonia who then suffers ANY 
        heart  problem has a poor prognosis. So I spent a large chunk of Saturday and Sunday traveling to
        Ohio and trying to sleep in the hospital.  I studied as much as I could, but sit here late Sunday
        way behind, exhausted and completely muddle-headed.
